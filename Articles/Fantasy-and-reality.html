          <p>Today we are going to take a look at something called fantasy and Reality.You know the basic let's take a different percpectic on it. Grab your coffee and lets dive in to topic.</p>

        <h2 class="notes-heading">First part is your pleasuring fantasy and another one is how you behave a certain role by fantasy.</h2>
        <div class="w-richtext">
          <p></p>
          <p>Do you ever wonder why often you get lost in the imagination of yours where you’re enjoying with your crush and saving her from the bad guys. This usually happen to my friend and he like to talk about that in this my writing. He is an introvert as nature, he is not shy and he also don’t like to hang around with many people. I think he can easily blend into the conversation. Beside that he have a little crush on a girl  I will keep the name secret for now. He imagine being with her in the fantasy about he is  spending beautiful dream with her. This is superficial but it is very dangerous for him because of this imagination he will not enjoy the reality and he have claimed that she is her in fantasy he act like he claimed her in reality. This is a huge bad news for him. My point is that you should be present in the reality and be bounded by reality. If you also go and dream, think getting a sexy girlfriend, nice jobs, six packs sadly but you are feeding your brain with dopamine, Which feel good in the moment but In result that later in life it will do effect in your life and it will make you less prone to happiness through the present time. Real things will not give you the happiness and pleasure you’re looking for you again go to the fantasy to give the brain.</p>
          <p>Not in every case fantasy is bad. Do you ever feel low in confidence and act like chris hemsworth and you can now talk with more confindence now, Good for you it worked out ha! But the point is that you have now access the reality through fantasy and it helped you. There is no such thing as reality as it is reality. We have to access the reality through the fantasy in other word you can say the identity shift although identity shift takes times and it is more permanent type of things. Let hop back to the fantasy thing just think this question who is your mother and what are you for your mother. Shaurabh! what the actual f**k are you talking about Yeah I know just answer it. From the question we can say that you play the fantasy of being the son/daughter to your mother and the mother play the fantasy of being the mother to you. In every possible human connection that their is a role you can say that and the role is access through the fantasy. You play the role of friend to your teacher it will not workout right? See where i am getting at . From above we can say that “WE ACCESS THE REALITY THROUGH FANTASY”. </p>
            <li>It's from the old self so don't mind the writing here.Hope you are having a good life.</li>
