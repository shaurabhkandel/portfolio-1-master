          <p>There is a famous quote by Sophocles “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” — Sophocles the interpretation is A zoom out outlook on life, but he’s not wrong. Just like people have good and bad sides, there’s a good
            and a bad side to everything. Every creation, invention, or object can be used wholesomely and with good intent or used in manipulative agitation or to purposefully cause harm. It’s imperative that we remain aware of the dangers our new
            technologies bring to the table. Nature of entertainment and its effects.p>

          <p>When discussing this theme, </p>
          <p>that media and entertainment have become so easy, so pleasurable, and so vast, that they are more appealing than real life, which has a high potential of leading to an unhealthy addiction. mass media and social media would end up
            becoming true to a frightening degree of accuracy. overtime technology and media have continued to progress at a disorienting rate. We have a phone in our pocket at all times that connects us to essentially anything we want, whenever we
            want. Cell phone service and Wi-Fi are everywhere. Social media have become pervasive. Computers and laptops are commonplace for everyone of all ages. There are too many TV networks and streaming platforms to count. The amount of content
            being produced, broadcasted, and uploaded into the world is unending. </p>
          <p>It is not that entertainment is bad, fundamentally. the problem arises when we lose self-control over our consumption and seeks constant, passive entertainment. the loss of control is becoming increasingly hard to avoid because of modern
            entertainment’s accessibility, commercialization, and addictive quality, making media and entertainment an easy, yet risky drug of choice. Social media is easy and fun, and what is easy is what requires nothing of the consumer and allows
            them to forget about the stresses of life and the challenges of being a human. As a result, entertainment has followed this path of least resistance, attending to the consumer’s base desires for pleasure and ease. Consequently,
            entertainment, in general, has become increasingly mindless, numbing, and distracting, rather than complex, nuanced, and thought-provoking. we often confuse what we want with what we need and vice versa, and by always giving in to our
            compulsions to feel pleasure, we are actually enslaving ourselves to our base nature and inhibiting any higher level of human experience. As sociological creature, we are constantly seeking Be as famous and wealthy as we can. We should
            want only to feel good all the time and turn away from anything that requires vulnerability, deep, challenging thought, sadness, or self-honesty. The problem is, the things that burden us as humans are always revolving inside us, and when
            we choose to pretend they aren’t there by veiling them with distractions, as a culture, and as individuals, we actually neglect to ever truly treat them, better understand ourselves, connect with others, and improve our life. We are some
            sort of hypnotized by technology and entertainment and find ourselves just distracted enough to be comfortable in our discomfort. </p>
          <p>What does all this mean for us? Are we hopeless to be further consumed by consumption, destineto reside in a limbo of sadness, isolation, and dissatisfaction? It depends. It is not that smartphones, social media, the internet, etc. are
            bad. They can be very useful and being entertained has its place in life. It is not like there aren’t plenty of other things we do to serve as distractions. </p>
          <p>However, the problem is that too much of anything is by nature too much, and when something feels so much better than real life and provides so much pleasure, it becomes addictive, and when it becomes addictive, we tend to shackled into
            much. Like a drug or alcohol, it becomes an escape that we keep returning to. Instead of dealing with life’s stresses and problems in healthy ways, thinking about them, talking about them, expressing them, and facing them, we pretend they
            don’t exist at all and turn to something that is not sustainable or fundamentally helpful as a means of solution. However, it is not hopeless. Mass media and entertainment are cultural phenomena but their consumption of them is an issue
            at the individual level. </p>
          <p> For many of us, we are in fact addicted to media and entertainment, but like any form of addiction, there is hope for recovery. that’s a good place to start if we in fact are. At which point we can begin to realize how healthy or
            unhealthy our choices are pertaining to what we consume and how often we consume. We don’t necessarily have to follow suit and entirely disconnect ourselves in this same way, because there are great benefits to engaging in media and
            entertainment. It is not all bad and passive. </p>
          <p>There are great shows, great movies, great YouTube channels, great websites, and so on. Ones that engage the viewer in ways that help them think, learn, consider, and develop. Content that makes the consumer feel less alone or actually
            addresses things that are difficult, sad, or honest, even if they’re not always very entertaining. Instead of disconnecting entirely, perhaps approaching our consumption with some amount of intention is more realistic, </p>
          <p>In life, there is value in effort, vulnerability, and selflessness. There is value in doing or watching things that make us work a little, feel a little gloomy, or think a little bit more than we’d like. There are parts of life that
            aren’t pleasurable, but good for us. Parts that aren’t entertaining, but important. A friendly piece of advice from me is To not always follow our desires for pleasure and ease, and instead, sometimes force ourselves to face our demons
            head-on. To challenge ourselves. To try to connect with, understand, and improve the world around us, instead of trying to escape it. Have a sexy day my friends.. </p>
